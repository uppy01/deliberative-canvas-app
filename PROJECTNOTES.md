- Earthstar package wouldn't install using node v22.5.1 (problem installing better-sqlite3 dependency) - got it installed using v.21.5.0
- need to npm install "@types/papaparse" to work with TypeScript (non-negotiable if in TS strict mode, however I've turned this off)
- to avoid errors and warnings when running and using output of "ng build", need to add the following...
    - ignore the dependency on node.js 'crypto' library
        - in package.json - `"browser": { "crypto": false }`
    - allowedCommonJsDependencies in angular.json
- boostrap gotcha's
    - referencing bootstrap classes in javascript messes with dropdowns, popovers etc - https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/32749
- to build and deploy using AWS Amplify hosting, need to manually set node.js version to minimum required by Angular compiler (currently v18.19.1)
    - do this in `hosting > build settings > build image settings > live package updates` section of the Amplify console.
- not sure if this should happen, but in kumu-links (child component) when you update any of the kumuMap object properties through the UI, the changes automatically bubble up to the selectedKumuMap object in adapter-pipeline (parent component)
    - based on my understanding of Angular parent-child conventions, this two-way binding shouldn't happen and instead should require having to emit an event from kumu-links that adapter-pipeline then listens for and manually updates selectedKumuMap...ðŸ¤”
- the 'fieldmappings.json' fetched from GitHub on app load is subject to GH's caching policy (~ 5 minutes), so any changes/commits to that file may not show up immediately in the app upon refresh/reload.
